Procedurally generated rollercoasters with Motion Tracking from Project Tango devices.

Coasterfy uses Project Tango motion tracking, C# hermite spline colliders and some simple scripting to procedurally generate a rollercoaster based on motion.

This project is going to work towards allowing the tango devices to map the worlds rollercoasters and then easily update them to a database that would allow others to ride it in virtual reality. 





Known issues:




Google Cardboard SDK is not working during the ride

Occasional spline root point glitches

Limited spline root count




Where this will go:

ADF to rollercoaster
 
Rollercoaster Simulator database

Thanks to everyone developing the Tango and the creators of these amazing assets!
