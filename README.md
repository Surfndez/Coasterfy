# Coasterfy
Procedurally generated roller coasters with Motion Tracking from Project Tango devices.


This uses Project Tango motion tracking, C# hermite spline colliders and some simple scripting
to hook up and procedually generate a rollercoaster based on motion.


 Ideally this would automaticly scale with the size of motion being drawn.
 
 One would be able to easily draw and design a rollercoaster in a room or bring the tango device to a rollercoaster and map that by riding in the front seat.
 
 It would be sweet if there was a platform to easily map, export and upload the worlds rollercoasters to a database that would allow people to ride every rollercoaster....

 
 
 Some known issues
 The game freezes when trying to resume go back to building
 Google cardboard sdk is not working when riding
 There seems to be a glitch everyonce and a while with the spline root
 spline root is limited by how many roots it can make before it stops woring correctly
 
 
 Where this will go in the short term
 Spline scaling
 speed scaling
 adf to rollercoaster
 
 The hermite spline controller is here http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Hermite_Spline_Controller
 The cart is from here https://sketchfab.com/models/hliAt7xc6YU2XjXh5G4lzmQwFmR and non commercial.
 
 Thanks to everyone developing the tango and the makers of these amazing Assets.
