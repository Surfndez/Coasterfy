Procedurally generated rollercoasters with Motion Tracking from Project Tango devices.

Coasterfy uses Project Tango motion tracking, C# hermite spline colliders and some simple scripting to procedurally generate a rollercoaster based on motion.



Scalling should be built in so one would be able to easily draw and design a rollercoaster anywhere, or bring a Tango device to a real-world rollercoaster and capture it simply by riding in the front seat.

It would be sweet if there was a platform to easily map, export and upload the world's rollercoasters to a database that would allow people to ride them....

Known issues:

Freezes when trying to go back to building from the ride


Google Cardboard SDK is not working during the ride

Occasional spline root point glitches

Limited spline root count


Where this will go in the short term:

Spline scaling
Speed scaling
ADF to rollercoaster

Thanks to everyone developing the Tango and the creators of these amazing assets!
